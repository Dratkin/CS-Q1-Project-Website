                <p id = "home_description">For those who are unaware, creepypastas are horror stories that are posted on the internet.
                     There are several aspects of creepypastas that make them unique from other types of horror stories. First of all, 
                     they incorporate many modern elements like social media websites, internet forums, and mobile devices 
                     just to name a few. Furthermore, much like many other genres of horror stories that exist today, creepypastas try their best 
                     to stay "grounded" or, in layman's term, to be small in scope. When done right, this contributes to the overall horror of the story by 
                     making it easier for the audience to believe that the events that transpire within the story can happen to just about any person.
